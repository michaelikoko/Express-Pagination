# Express.js Server-Side Pagination Example

This repository demonstrates server-side pagination in an Express.js application with MongoDB. It includes two implementations of pagination:

1. **Basic Pagination**: Custom implementation without external libraries.
2. **Library-Based Pagination**: Implementation using the `mongoose-paginate-v2` library.

Refer to the [tutorial](https:google.com) for detailed instructions on setting up, running, and testing the application.
